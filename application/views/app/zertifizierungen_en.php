			<h4 class="mb-2 text-success">ECOCERT certification</h4>
			<p>ECOCERT is an internationally recognised organisation for the certification of food and cosmetic products. The defined quality criteria set a standard for natural and organic cosmetics.
				STYX Naturcosmetic has been working closely with ECOCERT since 2011 to guarantee the highest quality standards.
				<br><br>
				During the certification, each individual product is checked. Particular attention is paid to the origin and quality of the raw materials and the processing in the company.
				Everyone involved in the added value process – from the raw material supplier to marketing – are checked during the certification by ECOCERT.
				In an ongoing process and continual dialogue, the whole STYX product portfolio is adapted to the standards. Already certified products can be recognised by the ECOCERT logo.</p>
