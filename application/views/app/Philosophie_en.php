							<h4 class="text-color-black">We are the only CO2 neutral climate alliance company in the natural cosmetics industry</h4>
						</div>
						<img src="<?=BASE_URL?>img/image/philosophie.jpg" class="img-fluid float-start me-4 mt-2" alt="" /><br>
						<h4>Philosophy</h4>
						<p>    STYX natural cosmetic products are made using plant-based raw materials from organic
							farming or wild collection and first-class plant oils. Climate-neutral production is
							as natural for us as the use of environmentally friendly, recyclable packaging.
							All our formulations are based on traditional knowledge combined with the latest
							production technologies. We create a bridge between tradition and modernity every day.<br>
							Find out more in our <a href="<?=BASE_URL?>img/pdf/STYX CSR BroschÃ¼re 2021.pdf">Sustainability Brochure</a> and
							<a href="<?=BASE_URL?>img/pdf/CSR Infoblatt A4 2021.pdf">CSR Info Sheet!</a>
						</p>

						<h4>Raw Materials</h4>
						<p>    We mainly source our raw materials from Austria or the home regions of the plants and herbs such as
							lavender from Provence. We strictly ensure the highest quality. The best raw materials such as herbs in organic quality or wild collection,
							cold-pressed plant oils or 100% pure essential oils are prerequisites for excellent natural cosmetic products with high effectiveness.
						</p>
						<h4>Packaging</h4>
						<p>    STYX Naturcosmetic places great emphasis on sustainability, and the topic of "packaging" is particularly important to us.
							At the same time, the needs of our customers are also growing, especially in terms of sustainable packaging.
							We are constantly looking for better and more sustainable solutions, but we must consider various criteria.

						<h4>Climate-Neutral Production</h4>
						<p>    Equal to the naturalness of the products is their ecologically sustainable production.
							The use of renewable energies is a matter of course for us. An in-house wood chip plant
							in conjunction with planned reforestation by our regional partners and the exclusive
							use of green electricity allow us to produce in a climate-neutral way.
						</p>

						<h4>Green Electricity from Naturkraft</h4>
						<p>    STYX uses exclusively green electricity generated from renewable energy sources such as water, wind, biomass, geothermal energy, or sun.
							By switching to green electricity, the company makes a valuable contribution to environmental protection and the use of natural resources.
							STYX has been operating a photovoltaic system since August 2013. The system includes collectors on an area of 280 m2, which
							produce around 54,000 kWh of electricity annually. The power of the sun is used optimally, as STYX already produces 30% of the annual electricity needs with solar energy.
							In 2011, STYX installed a biomass heating plant powered by wood chips. The wood chips
							are sourced from local farmers. The annual savings from the biomass heating plant amount to nearly 30,000 m3
							of gas and 58.5 tons of CO2 emissions. STYX thus produces completely CO2 neutrally. This achievement makes STYX unique in the European cosmetics industry.
						</p>
						<h4>Machine Park</h4>
						<p>STYX produces the entire range in three different production halls. Depending on the type of packaging, there are separate machines for jar filling,
							tube filling, and bottle filling. All raw materials are mixed in one of the two cream mixers. These have a capacity of 100 kg
							and 1,000 kg. With full capacity, up to 5,000 kg of creams can be produced daily.
						</p>
						<h4>Electric Car Fleet</h4>
						<p> The STYX electric car fleet now includes four vehicles and three charging stations. These vehicles are used for errands
							and deliveries within a radius of 80 km. The pollutant-intensive short trips can thus be carried out in an environmentally friendly way with one of the electric
							vehicles.
						</p>
						<h4>Warehouse</h4>
						<p> The finished products are then temporarily stored in one of the two warehouses and wait there for delivery to our customers.
							Our trained warehouse staff work with special software to ensure a professional inventory management system.
						</p>
						<h4>Shipping and Transport Concept</h4>
						<p> When packing our packages, we also pay attention to an ecological approach. We use cardboard chips,
							which we produce ourselves from our old cardboard boxes instead of bubble wrap and corn chips.
							This minimizes our cardboard waste and saves environmentally harmful plastic.
							<br>
							Transport is an important aspect for STYX. For this reason, there is intensive cooperation with our transport partners such as freight forwarders and parcel services.
							The goal is to raise awareness about sustainability and to implement measures that result in CO2 compensation. We consciously choose transport partners who have already successfully
							implemented sustainability management. We place particular emphasis on CO2-compensating measures. These are reviewed by us and
							further developed in a joint dialogue. The STYX transport concept is characterized by our environmentally conscious transport partners and our
							environmentally friendly delivery with electric cars.
