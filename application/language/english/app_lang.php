For more than 55 years, we have been processing the best nature has to offer, creating natural cosmetics that are appreciated for their quality in over 40 countries around the world. Tradition meets modernity with us, and the wealth of knowledge from our ancestors meets scientific findings. At STYX Naturcosmetic, this is not a contradiction but the foundation of our successful work. New procedures are continuously applied in our in-house laboratory to further optimize the effectiveness of our natural active ingredients. In our webshop, you can request product samples for a shipping fee and immediately be convinced of the naturalness and quality of the products. However, the term natural cosmetics means more than that. Alongside the products, their ecologically sustainable production must stand on an equal footing. Therefore, we have decided to rely on renewable energies at STYX. An in-house wood chip heating system combined with planned reforestation by our regional wood suppliers and the exclusive use of green electricity allow us to produce in a climate-neutral manner. Regionality is also very important to us. We source a large part of the raw materials from our immediate surroundings. Long-term partnerships with local organic farmers have developed, whose quality can be relied upon. The fact that the necessary transport routes can thereby be reduced to a minimum is another plus point for our ecological commitment.';
